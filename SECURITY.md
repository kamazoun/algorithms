## Supported Versions

This repository only contains algorithms that are unrelated to each other and that should normally at most only receiving user inputs and display outputs.

In case you find an error in any of the algorithms, or just find new ways to implement or improve them you can open a PR or an issue.

I often review the previous algorithms but not in a frequent manner. Thanks.
