    The number of recursive calls, C(n) satisfies the recurrence C(n) = 2C(n âˆ’ 1), which solves to C(n) = O(2^n). Since we spend O(n) time within a call, the time complexity is O(n2^n). The space complexity is O(n2^n), since there are 2^n subsets, and the average subset size is n/2. If we just want to print the subsets, rather than returning all of them, we simply perform a print instead of adding the subset to the result, which reduces the space complexity to O(n)

    Since each set takes O(n) time to compute, the time complexity is O(n2^n). In practice, this approach is very fast.
