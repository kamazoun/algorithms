        The efficiency here refers to space. Time will increase to O(n^2).
        The solution will make use of a running pointer. There are 2 ways to move the running pointer:
        1. Make a second pointer `prev` or `first` that will, at each move of the `current` pointer, go from the `head` to the `current` pointer. The major issue with that solution would be finding the current pointer to stop the iteration of `prev` as we only use `int` to recognize nodes. Of course, if well implemented, no other value equal to `current.data` would be found twice on the path of `prev` until it reaches `current`.
        2. Make a second pointer `next` or `last` that will, at each move of `current`, go from the node after current until the end of the LL. The issue here is that we would need to keep track of a `prev` node that we would use to jump `current` if its data is not unique.

    duplicated nodes that are to be removed, we do not need to first `reverse` to find the head. We can simply save
    the node n, and from there go forward and go backward to eliminate the duplicates. How would it be done?
    * The value of n is duplicated in the LL:
     ** The node before and after n hold the same value as n: By intuition, it feels better to first go backward (
     although in the doubly LL, backward and forward are relative) from n (the nodes before n that hold the same
     value as n will point to n.next). Then we will keep a variable pointing to the first not deleted node before n,
     so that if n is deleted, that node will point to the first not deleted node after n. We might also want to save
     the head node when found.

    * The value of n is not duplicated in the LL: We follow a process similar to what is described above,
    but as we do not know beforehand if n is duplicated, we use the same algorithm to find out.
