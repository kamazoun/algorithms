        The efficiency here refers to space. Time will increase to O(n^2).
        The solution will make use of a running pointer. There are 2 ways to move the running pointer:
        1. Make a second pointer `prev` or `first` that will, at each move of the `current` pointer, go from the `head` to the `current` pointer. The major issue with that solution would be finding the current pointer to stop the iteration of `prev` as we only use `int` to recognize nodes. Of course, if well implemented, no other value equal to `current.data` would be found twice on the path of `prev` until it reaches `current`.
        2. Make a second pointer `next` or `last` that will, at each move of `current`, go from the node after current until the end of the LL. The issue here is that we would need to keep track of a `prev` node that we would use to jump `current` if its data is not unique.

        Note: Practically there is no need to do that if the LL is not circular, because even if we start at a node, we will also need to restart at the head in order to complete the full LL as, there is no `prev` link to go backwards.
        So, I will work on this method with the assumption that the list is circular.
        One aspect to test when the list is circular, is how it behaves for a single pointing to itself.
        That also leads me to question the algorithm that should decide of the length of the list, because is the list has a unique node that points to itself, it should be a circular ll of length one. But if it has 2 nodes with the same data, it should be a circular ll of length 2.
        I guess, we can approach the problem, considering any number of adjacent nodes with the same value as 1 node.
        For instance 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 3 would give 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3.

    :idea: Here there are different ways to go about it. If there is no particular restriction on how to select the
    duplicated nodes that are to be removed, we do not need to first `reverse` to find the head. We can simply save
    the node n, and from there go forward and go backward to eliminate the duplicates. How would it be done?
    * The value of n is duplicated in the LL:
     ** The node before and after n hold the same value as n: By intuition, it feels better to first go backward (
     although in the doubly LL, backward and forward are relative) from n (the nodes before n that hold the same
     value as n will point to n.next). Then we will keep a variable pointing to the first not deleted node before n,
     so that if n is deleted, that node will point to the first not deleted node after n. We might also want to save
     the head node when found.

    * The value of n is not duplicated in the LL: We follow a process similar to what is described above,
    but as we do not know beforehand if n is duplicated, we use the same algorithm to find out.
