R'''
Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation.

import math
'''
There is the particular case where the bits fill the max length in the language: 1111..1100..0000. It is not possible to extend the number above that (ex. 32 bits used in java).
Python does not have this problem as there is no limit to the size of the bit_array

    A lot of off-by-one errors, and understanding the difference between the `position` of a bit and its `index`. Counts start at 0. Shifts of 0 have no effects.
    The secret of solving this problem optimally is to figure out that we do not need to consider so many cases, but only if the bit we are interested in is non-trailing or not.
