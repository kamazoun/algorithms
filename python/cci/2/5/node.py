"""
Here is what I got from a conversation with Gemini:
When you assign another node to the next parameter of a node in a linked list, what's actually stored is a reference (or a pointer).  
You're not copying the entire data of that node. Instead, you're essentially creating a shorthand that directly points to the memory location of the next node.

Member Access with `.`: When you use code like first_node.next.data, Python first dereferences the next pointer in the first node. It retrieves the memory location stored there and follows that location to access the actual next node.
Automatic Dereferencing: Python then recognizes that data is an attribute of the retrieved node and uses the value stored in that node's data attribute.
