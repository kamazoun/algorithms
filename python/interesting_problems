1.5: It would be easy to misunderstand the question and solve for `at most one difference in the letters of the words`. But the real problem requires to have `at most one 'edit' difference between the words`.

1.6: In multiple implementations the algorithm does not add the last character: for instance `aabcccccaaa` would be compressed to `a2b1c5` instead of `a2b1c5a3`. In one of the implementations the error occurred because at the end of the for loop, the last character and its count were not added to the dict.
To put it simply, the common implementation error was not being able to `compress` the last same-character substring. I only found the error after testing.

1.7: Can be very confusing for the in-place solution: You need to define well the subscript of the matrix.

1.9: One solution is quite brilliant and simple but hard to spot.

2.1: Interesting sub-problems can be derived. ACTUALLY THIS ENDED UP BEING THE MOST INTERESTING & INSTRUCTIVE PROBLEM AT THIS POINT.

2.3: The author's solution was simple and brilliant. The problem raises some nice questions.

2.5: Needs a lot of subtle thinking, particularly for the follow up. Particularly, the choice of solving it `recursively` can affect quite a lot of things and much more when dealing with the follow-up.

3.3: S&Q not difficult but with a lot edge cases.

3.4: requires just a little tact (what's the difference between a stack and a queue or how do they relate), but couldn't find it fast enough.
