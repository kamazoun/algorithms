R'''
O(mn + mk) n: size of the array, m number of digits in `longest` number, k the range of the current system (for decimal, k = 10)
Does not work on anything else but positive integer. This can be adjusted though by separating the negative and positive numbers or using abs().
To add float functionality, we can simply use a dict instead of a list.
