# Maintaining the heap property
def max_heapify(arr : list, i : int, heap_size = None):
    R'''
    We assume that the trees rooted at Left(i) and Right(i) are max-heaps, but arr[i] might be smaller than its children, thus violating the max-heap property. At each step, the largest of the elements arr[i], arr[Left(i)], and arr[Right(i)] is set as the root of the tree rooted at i. If arr[i] was the largest the procedure ends. Otherwise the largest is swapped with arr[i] and because the swap could have messed the heap property in the subtree rooted at the swapped index, we recursively call max_heapify() on the swapped index.

# Building a heap
def build_max_heap(arr):

    Builds a max-heap out of arr.
    The elements [n // 2 ... n] are all leaves, so [0 ... n // 2 - 1] are roots.
    So we call max_heapify() on these in reversed order. What we obtain is a max-heap.

def heapsort(arr):
    R'''
    We first make a max-heap out of arr, by calling build_max_heap().
    Then we swap max element with last element. We discard this last element by reducing heap_size.
    We call max_heapify to restore the heap property after the swap.
    We repeat this process until there is only two elements left.
