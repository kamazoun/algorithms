R'''
Design an algorithm that takes as input an array and a number, and determines if there are three
entries in the array (not necessarily distinct) which add up to the specified number. For example,
if the array is [11, 2, 5, 7, 3] then there are three entries in the array which add up to 21 (3, 7, 11 and
5, 5, 11). (Note that we can use 5 twice, since the problem statement said we can use the same entry
more than once.) However, no three entries add up to 22.

    Assumes that a is sorted, as it is to be used with sum_3, else we'd sort it.

        elif (a[i] + a[j]) > n:
            j -= 1
