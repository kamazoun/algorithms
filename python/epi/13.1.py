R'''
In this problem you are to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner of a 2D array
and getting to the bottom-right corner. All moves must either go right or down.

    The time complexity is O(nm), and the space complexity is O(nm).
    A more analytical way of solving this problem is to use the fact that each path from (0, 0) to (n − 1, m − 1) is a sequence of m − 1 horizontal steps and n − 1 vertical steps. There are combination of (n+m−2) in (n−1) = (n+m−2)! / (n−1)!(m−1)! such paths

        This is the first that I experiment the books' sayings `Recursive algorithms are easier (more natural) to implement that their iterative counterparts`.
        I first tried to solve this iteratively and couldn't even think of a way to put it in code. Next we'll
