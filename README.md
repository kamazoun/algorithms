# algorithms
A repo of algorithmic solutions to various problems found online (codejam, kickstart, ...), in books (Cracking the Coding Interview, Elements of Programming Interviews, ...) and from other sources.
The questions are not mine, as are some of the algorithms. Usually I will try to tag an algorithm as mine, the question author's (or a modification of the author's algorithm).
Some of the goals are to reduce the time and space complexities, find elegant solutions, make them as simple and intuitive as possible.

## Regarding issues
If you open an issue, please do `tag` me or just assign the issue to me.
Also, please do not propose a solution in the issue but rather in a discussion.
Thanks!
